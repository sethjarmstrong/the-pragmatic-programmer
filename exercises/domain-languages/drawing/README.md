We want to implement a mini-language to control a simple drawing package
(perhaps a turtle-graphics system). The language consists of single-letter
commands. Some commands are followed by a single number. For example, the
following input would draw a rectangle.

    P 2  # select pen 2
    D    # pen down
    W 2  # draw west 2cm
    N 1  # then north 1
    E 2  # then east 2
    S 1  # then back south
    U    # pen up

Implement the code that parses this language. It should be designed so that it
is simple to add new commands.
